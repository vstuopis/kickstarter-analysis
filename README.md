# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
The project reviewed the overall status of the different types of Kickstarters that were created. We took a look at key metrics for specific areas of the campaign based off categories and subcategories in addition to the location the Kickstarter was created. We reviewed the Campaign outcomes based off the Parent Category of the campain ![Outcomes based on Parent Category](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113248280/196854705-b89602a3-45af-4f35-91b4-77451fa647c4.png).

We also took a deeper look into the Great Britain Kickstarter Campaigns for the Musical Subcategory where we noticed a large discrepancy between the goals for these Kickstarters and their actual pledged donations. ![Great Britain Musical Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113248280/196854955-aa7cbab1-7827-415b-aa89-c1cf09e0b814.png)

Based on our findings and analysis we recommend not submitting any Musical Kickstarter Campaigns in Great Britain with a goal of over $2,000 as this will allow for more successful campaigns to be launched. We also recommend further commiting to Music Parent Category Campaigns which currently are the most successful ones being run.
